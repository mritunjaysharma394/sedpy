`sedpy` is an open-source project being built as a cross-platform alternative of [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) for easier and more flexible stream line editing across BSD and GNU systems.

# What is sed and what is sedpy?

The `sed` command, short for stream editor, performs editing operations on text coming from standard input or a file. sed edits line-by-line and in a non-interactive way.

This means that you make all of the editing decisions as you are calling the command, and sed executes the directions automatically. This may seem confusing or unintuitive, but it is a very powerful and fast way to transform text, especially as part of a script or automated workflow.

The problem with `sed` is that it's not purely cross-platform. Linux uses GNU-based `sed` while macOS has the BSD version of `sed`.As a result - both have quite important syntactic and usage difference. At the same time, `sed`, though extremely powerful, is quite complex to use. 

The `sedpy` project tries to solve exactly both of these problems. The `sedpy` project initially supports only stream text replacement (supports regex). The future scope of the project is huge and requires continuous feedback and support from all of you amazing folks out there!

## Quick Installation
The easiest way to install sedpy is using PyPi `pip`: 

    pip install sedpy
           or
    pip3 install sedpy

## Installation using Source:

1. Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/mritunjaysharma394/sedpy.git

2. Enter the `sedpy` directory:

        cd sedpy

3. Install using:

        pip3 install -e .

This should successfully install the `sedpy` cli package.

As an alternative for Step 3, you can also use:

    ./install.sh

If `./install.sh` fails to work, try running it after changing it's access:

    $ sudo chmod a+x install.sh

## How to use?

As a sample, you can download the [test.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mritunjaysharma394/sedpy/master/examples/test.txt) file. We can play with it to learn about it's very basic usage:

The contents of `test.txt` file as of now reads:

    7 + 4 = 13

We will use `sedpy` cli to change the '4' to '6' without opening the `test.txt` file.Just enter below command and see the magic:

    sedpy "4" "6" test.txt

**NOTE**: `test.txt` argument may differ according to the location where you have stored it.

Now when you open `test.txt`, file will now read as:

    7 + 6 = 13

So you can observe that `sedpy` can be used as:

    sedpy "initial string" "string to replace it" "path to the file where changes have to be made"

Thank you so much for having fun with this! This is just the initial release. More major updates on the cards :tada:
